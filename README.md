# Project description

The project consists of an API build with java spring-boot [here](./backend), and in the future a typescript client of the API for the browser.

This service is about various people part of the app being able to share the books they own with others, somewhat as an extension of libraries.
The lending would theoretically be done in person, without any authorative administration. As such, any punishment possibly given by the server
would be to block the user from any further interactions after multiple complaints of late returns or complete failure of giving back books.

Tell me what i may be missing/doing wrong. Spring not working with direct function calls makes finding out about the features and its details a
bit tough.
